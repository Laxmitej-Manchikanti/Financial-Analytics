Analysis of top 500 companies in India based on market capitalization and sales quarterly.
Here in the dataset provided after cleaning the data there are 499 companies that we have to analyze based on market capitalization and quarterly sales of respective companies.
In this dataset, after cleaning I calculated mean, min, and max of market cap and quarterly sales. After this process, I have implemented visualization on market cap and qtrly sales using Power BI. I used bar chart, scatter plot, pie chart to make the analysis of these companies more understandable in the market. 
So based on Market capitalization Reliance Industries are on top 5,83,486.72cr followed by TCS which has 5,63,709.84cr as market capitalization.
In sum of sales quarterly, IOCL is leading with 1,10,666.93cr followed by reliance industries 99,810 Cr.

Extracted Top 10 companies based on market cap and sales quarterly filters respectively in Power BI to obtain analysis of both the metrics.
